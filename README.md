# Fake-Products-Recognition-System 🚀
##Dataset Story 📊
This dataset consists of images depicting both genuine and counterfeit products. The images were collected from various sources such as online marketplaces, retail stores, and manufacturer databases. The primary goal of this dataset is to train a machine learning model to identify counterfeit products accurately. By analyzing this dataset, we aim to develop a system that can distinguish between real and fake products, helping businesses and consumers avoid counterfeit goods.

##Business Problem 💼
The business problem at hand is to create a reliable system that can predict whether a product is genuine or counterfeit based on its image. This prediction can help manufacturers, retailers, and consumers detect fake products, thereby protecting brand integrity and consumer safety. Understanding and predicting counterfeit products will enable businesses to take proactive measures to prevent their distribution, ultimately reducing financial losses and safeguarding consumer trust. 🌟

##Project Steps 🛠️

##Data Collection 📷
Gathered a total of 750 images representing a diverse range of products, both genuine and counterfeit. Images were sourced from online marketplaces, retail environments, and direct manufacturer contributions to ensure a comprehensive dataset

##Data Annotation 🏷️
Each image was meticulously annotated with labels indicating whether the product is genuine or counterfeit. Annotations also included product categories and specific features to enhance the model's learning capabilities.

##Data Splitting 🔄
The dataset was split into 669 images for training, 40 for testing, and 40 for validation. This split ensures that the model is trained on a broad set of examples while being rigorously tested on unseen data.

##Model Selection 🤖
We selected YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8) as our primary model due to its outstanding performance in real-time object detection tasks. YOLOv8 is known for its speed and accuracy, making it ideal for distinguishing between genuine and counterfeit products in various conditions.

##Model Building and Training 🛠️
Utilized YOLOv8 to train on the annotated dataset, optimizing for both speed and accuracy. The model was tuned to handle the complexities of different product categories and various environmental conditions depicted in the images.

##Model Evaluation 📈
Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The goal is to ensure the model is both highly accurate and reliable in identifying counterfeit products.

##By following these steps, we aim to develop a robust system capable of detecting counterfeit products with high accuracy, helping businesses protect their brands and ensuring consumer safety. 🌟💼
